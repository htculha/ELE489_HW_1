# ELE489_HW_1 

In this project, i tried to write a k-nn algorithm using the wine characteristics dataset given to us. I divided the dataset into two and used it as traninig and test sets. I wrote the nearest k neighbor algorithm using Euclidian and Manhattan length calculations. I also observed whether the result changed when I removed unnecessary overlap features by normalizing the data and calculating f parameters, and the result changed. I made an error-free classification. But this result was predictable due to the small size of the dataset.
